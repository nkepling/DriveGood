        - Define our custom perception type
            - Timestamping
            - Assiging to track id
            - PoE values. 
        - Implement our EFK to handle noise in our BB state estimate
        - Implement helper function to do process camera measuments and extract state estimates
        - Implement "tracks" module that will handle the tracking of objecs overtime. 
            - This module will handle the logic for dealing with false positives, false negatives, and multiple detections.
            - Will compute probabilty of existence for each object in the track.

        - Produce some kind of message that lets other components know where other vehicles are in 

        - vector of other vehcile states info, planal location, heading, velo, maybe size... 
        - maintain a list of vehicel states.. 
        - To start up populate some message from GT so that the decision making can use it. 'Get the piping done'
        - Next step start if detect bb say there is an obstacle say 10 meters in front of me. 

        EKF>>>>

        Dynamically spawn and and destroy EKF... So if you have two BBs in an image you need to keep track of two EKFs for each BB
        # No false positives ===> No cars there is not BBs 
        # All cars are the same height.. 
        # so all we need to know is [x,y ,θ, v] (uknown state: stuff we estimate with EKF)
        # the known state =  [z, l, w, h] , big rectangles that slide around (constants that we set and can dig around the source code and find)
        # Need an init prior for [x,y ,θ, v]... the height can be in full field of view. So if i know size of car, and pixels, you get get a guess of the depth..
